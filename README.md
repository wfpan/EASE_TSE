# EASE_TSE
This is the replication package for our work submitted to IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, i.e., Weifeng Pan, Xin Du, Hua Ming, Dae-Kyoo Kim, Zijiang Yang. EASE: XXX. IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 2022, submitted. [[PDF](#)]

# CCN_WD
This directory contains the CCN_WDs that we built for all the subject systems used in our experiments. There are three versions of CCN_WDs according to different weighting mechanisms (i.e., OWM, DWM, and EWM). Note that a detailed data set will be available after our work's acceptance. Of course, interested readers can email us (Email: wfpan@zjgsu.edu.cn) to get the whole data set in advance. Please use your institutional email address.

# code
This directory will contain the source code that we used to perform all the experiments after our work's acceptance. Now it is null.

# RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3
These directories contain the results that we used to answer the RQs.

# Cite our work
If you use our data set or tool, please cite our work.
